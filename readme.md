# Gorko Custom Properties Demo

<https://gorko-themes.netlify.app>

This is a tiny little demo that shows Gorko themes support. By default, the user preferred dark or light mode will be honoured but the toggles will trigger other themes, including dark mode. 

Check out [the config](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/gorko-themes-demo/blob/main/scss/_config.scss) and [global Sass file](https://github.com/andy-piccalilli/gorko-themes-demo/blob/main/scss/global.scss).
